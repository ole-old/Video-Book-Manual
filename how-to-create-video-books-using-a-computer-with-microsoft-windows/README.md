# 1 - Download and install screen cast software
Microsoft offers for free a piece of software that will help you make screen casts.
The software is called Microsoft Windows Media Encoder and it is the software we will demonstrate in this how-to.
You can download the software by following [this link](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17792).
Warning: do not download this software from anyone other than Microsoft as it may end up being a virus you download.

When the download has finished, double click the installer and follow the instructions.

# 2 - Pick a PDF, group of images, or presentation and open it on your screen

When opening a book to view, probably want to fit the pages so they fill the maximum amount of screen space.
In Adobe Reader you can do this by going to *View -> Zoom -> Fit Page*
