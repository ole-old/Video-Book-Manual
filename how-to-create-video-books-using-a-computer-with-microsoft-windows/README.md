# 1 - Download and install screen cast software

Microsoft offers for free a piece of software that will help you make screen casts.
The software is called Microsoft Windows Media Encoder and it is the software we will demonstrate in this how-to.
You can download the software by following [this link](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17792).
Warning: do not download this software from anyone other than Microsoft as it may end up being a virus you download.
