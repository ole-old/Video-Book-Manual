# 1 - Download and install screen cast software
Microsoft offers for free a piece of software that will help you make screen casts.
The software is called Microsoft Windows Media Encoder and it is the software we will demonstrate in this how-to. You can download the software by following [this link](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17792). Warning: do not download this software from anyone other than Microsoft as it may end up being a virus you download.

When the download has finished, double click the installer and follow the instructions.

# 2 - Pick a PDF, group of images, or presentation and open it on your screen
When opening a book to view, probably want to fit the pages so they fill the maximum amount of screen space. In Adobe Reader you can do this by going to *View -> Zoom -> Fit Page*

# 4 - Create the Video Book Recording with Microsoft Windows Media Encoder

I recommend doing the following instructions twice so that you may give yourself a test run to make sure you are selecting the appropriate settings. It would be a bummer to read a whole book to find out the Microphone on your computer wasn't turned on :-).  

Open the Microsoft Windows Media Encoder program and select the *Capture screen* option.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64516474@N05/8618511571/" title="window-media-encoder-screen-capture-setup by rjstatic, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8618511571_6f39b5e9fe.jpg" width="500" height="392" alt="window-media-encoder-screen-capture-setup"></a>

To save on screen space and resulting data size of the Video Book, we'll select just a portion of the screen to record. Select the *Region of the screen* option and don't forget to check the *Capture audio from default device* option so your voice is recorded.

Get your book's application window placed behind the Media Encoder's window and then click the  *screen region selection button* as seen in the attached screen shot.

The Media Encoder program will vanish and you will be alllowed to click and drag on the screen to select the portion of the screen you would like to record. In screen shot below, I've selected just the portion of the screen that the book will be shown on as to not record any of the other things irrelevent to the video book, things like the sidebars and menu.

When you finish your click and drag selection of the screen, Media Encoder will reappear and show you the coordinates you selected. Don't forget to check *Capture audio from default device* as to make sure the screen recording will record your voice during recording. Now you can click *Next*.

Now it's time to choose a name for the file that your Video Book will be known as.
In the example below I've chosen to name the file *Peter-Rabbit.wmv* and it will be saved to my *Desktop* when the recording is finished. Click *next* to proceed when you are satisfied with your file name.

Now it's time to choose the quality of the video book you will record.  Higher quality takes up more space on the disk but the text is more readable while lower quality video takes up less space on the disk but small text can be hard to read.  You will have to make a judgement call on which video quality setting is right for your video book.  For Peter Rabbit, the medium setting is appropriate.

Now Media Encoder will ask you to fill out some meta information about this Video Book. Some video players will display this information along side the video.  Click next when you have filled out the form.

Now it's time to record your book. Click *Begin capturing screen when I click finish* and then click "Finish". Windows Media Encoder will minimize and start recording the region of the screen you selected.

When you are done recording, navigate back to Windows Media Encoder and click *Stop recording*.
