# Video Books, the Manual

Video books cost little to produce and require very little knowledge of computers to produce.  In this manual we have written guides on how to produce video books for various platforms. Thanks for reading and we look forward to seeing your own video book!  If you are interested in education and computing in offline locations, join the [listserve on Ground Computing]().
