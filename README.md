# Video Books, the Manual

Inspired by Sal Khan's chapter on "No-Frills Videos" in his book [One World Schoolhouse](http://books.google.com.gh/books?id=xz-gkDYm4UUC&dq=one+world+schoolhouse&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rStfUeWECanG7AalqYEw&redir_esc=y), Video Books are tool for delivering a reading from a book to early grade readers when the teacher's time is best spent doing activities directly with the students as opposed to standing in front of a class and lecturing.  Video Books cost little to produce and require very little knowledge of computers to produce. In this manual we have written guides on how to produce video books for various platforms. This manual is a work in progress so please do feel free to fork and send us a pull request or speak up in [this manual's issue queue](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/Video-Book-Manual/issues). If you help out we'll happily add you to the [Credits](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/Video-Book-Manual#credits). Thanks for reading and we look forward to seeing your own video book!
